2015,"The electrical consumption mitigation provided by energy storage systems can be unreliable when a consumption peak lasts long enough to deplete the energy stored and the remainder of the peak is unmitigated. By implementing a waiting period between detecting the peak and discharging the energy storage in which characteristics of the peak are observed, a peak mitigation system can lengthen the effective discharge duration of the energy storage system and prevent unmitigated plateaus from appearing. For example, when a consumption plateau is detected, the system may discharge at a slower rate than when a spike is detected in order to prolong mitigation activities before the conclusion of the plateau. Thus otherwise-incurred demand-related utility charges can be reduced without having to increase the capacity of the mitigation system. In some cases, these processes are performed with respect to the bounds of demand-averaged time periods used to calculate demand charges."

2012,"Recent electric load facilities are in the trend standing opposite with the power converting system%power conversion system which mostly depends on on the power switching element. And accordingly the power conversion device including the changeable speed drive (ASD) and uninterruptible power supply system (UPS) of the electric motor, the DC/DC converter about the inverter for the power conversion of the neogonesis energy and SMPS etc. is very much used. In this power conversion device, generally the aluminium electrolysis capacitor is used in the DC Bus part of the electric power inverter for the reduction of the temporary storing of the smoothing dragon of the voltage or energy and switching pulsating current etc. In this way, it is due to have advantages that the discoloration, moreover, the high voltage-resistant of size is possible while the use of the electrolytic capacitor as to many reasons, has the capacity which relatively is big in comparison with the other capacitor while cost is inexpensive. But because such life time enlargement of the capacitor acts as the main part risk factor of the accident of causing the steam spurt (vaporization) and explosion of the electrolyte etc. while the deterioration gradually goes on it is necessary to have the fault daignostics through the parameter analysis of the capacitor inside for its reliability insurance and life prospect etc. There can be the method for measuring temperature of method of predicting the lifetime it produces and the other capacitor core inside method of estimating C value of the capacitance and the equivalent series resistance (hereinafter it calls with the equivalent series resistor because of being the ESR) etc as the method therefor. And but most of method for estimatings most of diagnositic tools therefore prefer the method for estimating of ESR with the implementation issue, and the restriction called the presence of the allowable error value are the configuration and online of the laboratory device. The online process therefore emerges as the main issue with advantage the power conversion device does not separate the capacitor from the system although it has among the operation and that its ESR estimator method can measure. A method of computing this using the Afroz M. Imam is the adaptive signal process (LMS) technique from the effective value electric power of the capacitor and current J W. Kolar, *** radical etc. suggested the mode etc. estimated ESR from this approached moreover, its pulsation component the power loss concept of AC towards with the method for estimating ESR analyzed size this according to the frequency component passed this through in the specific band pass filter measured the pulsating voltage and current component of the capacitor were presented in the background technique of the present invention. But techniques proposed with their depend on the signal processing algorithm using the complex operation process and DSP board and it exists to be disadvantageous in the implementation and price side. The kernel of a technical problem to be solved by the present invention is the direct current bus capacitor ESR estimator method technology of the cheap mode. Therefore, in the present invention, the power conversion device did not use the instrumentation of the separate LCR meter having among the pause and the capacitor ESR estimator of the cost-effective mode in which the complex DSP board was unnecessary was designed. In the present invention, it is the method it decides on the boost type DC/DC converter with the configuration (Figure 8) by using the direct current bus capacitor of the power conversion device to diagnose and for doing the size about the change of the voltage ([IMAGE]) and current ([IMAGE]) according to the ON / OFF state of the main switch (15) with measurements (21, 22, 23) and ESR the estimation (25). This has the advantage that it can estimate to the oscilloscope without the separate equipment. And cost can be inexpensive and the carrying can be possible in the product manufacturing since estimating ESR as the simple component. Was good result (fig. 11, fig. 12, and fig. 13) of the simulation for verifying the proposed method of the present invention showed up. And its result the extended application is possible in the failure diagnosis system which it is done by the beginning of the or more (Abnormal) sign in the future in case the estimate of the electrolytic capacitor ESR is the normal value comparison about two times or greater. The aluminium electrolysis capacitor while cost is inexpensive capacity is large and it has the property of the high voltage-resistant and the property is used for the voltage smoothing of the power conversion device compared to the other capacitor etc. But while this capacitor the evaporation of the electrolyte and deterioration and damage increase is aggravated the accident of continuing to the explosion occurs.
