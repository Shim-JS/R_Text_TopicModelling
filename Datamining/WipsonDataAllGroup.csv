2011,"The invention relates to the apparatus for watching the abnormal current of the electric power system. And by nots smoothing and using the bridge diode the AC signaling detected from the electric power system with the direct current the abnormal current is watched only the full-wave rectification after doing the performance heartburnings. Particularly, in the electric power system through the current transformer (CT) and log ski coil, the current and voltage are detected. The accident happening whether or not is parallely watched by using this. The answer delay by the rise time to be generated when smoothing the AC signaling with the direct current through the capacitor can be prevented. Even when rapidly answering in the point of time when the first abnormal current is generated the error by the chattering is prevented and the stable operation can be. Accordingly, it can be effectively applied to the electric power system protective gear demanding the response characteristics of being fast like the supercurrent current limit."

2011,"The DPR according to the present invention can interface the mobile communications terminal of the administrator through the mobile radio communications network. For this, DPR includes the mobile radio communications network interface module having its own generic number and send and can receive the text message through the mobile radio communications network. And the text message received through the mobile radio communications network interface module is analyzed and the command which the corresponding text message indicates is performed. The operation state information of DPR is transmitted to the mobile communications terminal of the administrator. DPR can be managed the administrator through the mobile communications terminal including the cellular phone etc. Therefore in which oneself always carries and which goes to and from in order to set up the operation state of DPR or confirm it one by one is no need to visit the installation place. By using the cheap short message service (SMS) in the environment in which the communications system for the remote control is not constructed it is easy and it is convenient DPR is managed."
2011,"More efficiently, the invention uses energy through the access method fitting foot with the trend to efficiently use the source of energy which is restricted the smart grid and smart M technology are commercialized and the change of the price of energy is enforced etc and predicts the use of energy charge of the discrete energy use instrument. For this, in M, the change of the whole amount of energy consumption per time is detected. By per hour comparing with the amount of energy consumption with the energy use instrument unit is this variation inputted in advance the operation state of the angle-energy use instrument is grasped.

The foreseen outcome can be applied with the various method for the efficient usage of energy."
2011,"More efficiently, the energy management server of the remote site controlling the use of energy information of the angle-energy consumer and M (Meter) installed at angle-energy consumer is the energy related information decreased and the invention receives. For this, it provides the real-time energy tariff system information or the information applied to like the upgrade information to multiple M in common through the digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) network. It decreases through the bidirectional communications network like the internet network and the information to be individually treated like the inspection information about each M receives. Accordingly, the communications traffic made between the energy management server and multiple smart Ms can be dispersed. Particularly, if the DMB network is used the upgrade about the multiple M can be more easy and the upgrade can be made."
