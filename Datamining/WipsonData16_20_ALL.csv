2019,"The invention relates to a method for the short-cyclic data capture of energy system data in the power supply system for energy monitoring and for system control in the smart metering/smart grid using a piece of distributed, intelligent middleware. Customary systems implement the data capture in the power supply system and implement the intelligence of the data processing on an application level, which is executed on central servers, or on the measurement and control level. A piece of middleware is at best located on the application level and then allows the communication between the applications. The middleware used in the method acts as an intelligent layer between the application level with energy monitoring and/or billing systems, for example, and the measurement and control level with a multiplicity of digital meters and actuators of the widest variety of designs, as shown in Fig. 1. In this case, the middleware allows the communication with the digital meters and actuators via interfaces in the device-specific transmission protocols. Therefore, the meter communication is totally isolated from the application level. The method is characterized in that it distributes the intelligence locally, according to need, in the information infrastructure of the ""Smart Grid"" as distributed middleware. Said intelligence can therefore be optimally matched to an available energy supply system topology and installed as appropriate (clustering). The distributed middleware is capable of capturing the state of the respective energy supply system cluster in short cycles (in real time), using digital meters and further sensors. It operates in a manner detached from the application level and is always active. Following the data capture, the middleware either initiates an appropriate agent-supported optimization strategy, for example for regulating the flow of energy, itself or calls the optimization via a superordinate application (App). In addition, it provides an ideal infrastructure for the migration of further software agents and middleware services. By way of example, a local optimization middleware service allows the formation of ""virtual power stations"" and/or ""virtual households"" directly on the middleware level and therefore reduces the volume of information for superordinate applications. Each intelligent node of the distributed middleware can be implemented by a low-resource system (embedded system) and designed dynamically and flexibly."

2019,"An EN61000-3-2 compliant lighting apparatus sized for minimum crest factor criteria or for maximum efficiency, that sinks from the grid rectangular current pulses AM, high frequency PWM, instrinsic PWM or random modulated, consisting of a rectifier bridge, a constant current source series-connected with a sequence of [N x M] high power [HP] and high brightness [HB] LEDs, series-connected and organized in N segments times M LEDs each, segments that can be introduced or removed from the circuit by short-circuiting them by an individual switch, except for the segment to the current source, a resistor voltage divider setting the voltage switching tresholds at which the LED segments are introduced or removed from the circuit and a voltage reference modulated or not by a signal un-correlated to the network voltage. Upon connecting the grid to the input terminals A and B of the circuit displayed in Figure 5, the grid alternate voltage is full wave rectified by the rectifier bridge and is applied to the string of N x M luminiscent diodes [LED] series-connected with the constant current source. Upon increasing the UAB voltage between 0 and up to reaching the conduction value of the segment with the highest SN parameter that is permanently present in circuit, in series with the constant current source, the current sink by the apparatus. At the hereinafter increase of voltage at AB terminals, the current through SN segment and through the constant current source increases exponentially up to th value set by the constant current source, through the switch made by transistor QN-1 by-passing segments SN-1... S1. Observing the serial presence of the constant current source, the voltage drop across segment SN is limited and consistent to the constant current set by the current source. For UAB voltages lower than the maximum voltage drop on a series of LEDs supplied at that constant current, the full input voltage drops at the terminals of segment SN; As input voltages exceed the above mentioned maximum drop voltage, the balance will drop on the constant current source. When the input voltage exceeds the threshold values set via the R1, R2+...+RN resistive divider, the switch consisting the transistor QN-1 and controlled by the corresponding comparator, gets switched off, thus introducing the segment SN-1 in the circuit, in series with SN. The sink current drops to a value set by UAB voltage, quadruplicated to MN+MN-1 number of diodes from segments SN si SN-1 present in series and their curent to voltage curve. Hereinafter, as the UAB voltage successively exceeds the threshold values set by the R1, R2, RN resistive dividers, the schematic introduces successively in the circuit, in series with the already existing segments, additional segments that undertake voltage drops from the constant current source. Upon the decrease UAB voltage at AB terminals, the process is carried out in a reverse way, namely upon each drop in UAB voltage, below the threshold levels set by the resistive dividers made of R1, R2,... RN, the schematic successively removes from the circuit and in a reverse order as above, LED segments, by-passing them with the appropriate switch. The power conversion efficiency and the crest factor are being set by simply fixing the N [the number of segments] and the switching threshold levels,. Following the above described successive switch, I have ensured a sequence of constant amplitude current pulses, approximately rectangular, starting at approximately 0.2mS and lasting up to approximately 9.8ms from the zero crossing of grid voltage is sinking through the LEDs. To get EN61000-3-2 compliance, the sink current is amplitude, HF-PWM, LF intrinsec PWM or random modulated so that the envelope of real time or average sink current follows the? i trapezoid"" trapezoidal profile, indicated in Figure 4. If setting the driver for maximum efficiency, the harmonic spectrum of the sink current does not comply with EN61000-3-2, its harmonic amplitudes between approximately 1kHz and 3kHz, being some 3% higher than the limit. For EN61000-3-2 compliance the spectrum of sink current is scattered by modulating the reference voltage by low frequency uncorrected to the grid. Spectrum scattering through such method reduces the amplitude of the harmonic components by some 8dB thus offering a safe margin to the limit. Comparing the maximum theoretical performances achievable through the various modulation methods, it is noticed that for a given structure of 10 x 10 LEDs, they are grouped. Under these circumstances, the election of the modulation method is technical and price based. In the real life the efficiency is affected by power losses in the current source, in switches and on rectifier bridge. A superficial calculation, sets these additional losses in the area of 1.5% which affects the theoretical efficiency to approximately 92%. Nevertheless the efficiency losses can be offset by simply gliding the switching thresholds to the point..."

2016,"A renewable energy extraction device, such as a wind turbine generator includes a turbine driving a hydraulic pump and a variable displacement hydraulic motor driving an electrical generator connected directly to an electricity grid. The hydraulic motor employs electronically controlled valves operated to select the net displacement of working chambers of the hydraulic motor on each successive cycle of working chamber volume. In the event of an electric grid fault causing the maximum absorbable torque of the electrical generator to collapse, the electronically controlled valves are controlled to substantially reduce the rate of displacement of working fluid by the hydraulic motor, rapidly reducing the torque exerted on the generator rotor. This has the benefit of avoiding pole slip which could otherwise cause serious damage. During the fault, the rate of displacement of working fluid by the hydraulic motor is controlled to maintain the phase and frequency of rotation of the generator rotor in synchrony with the electricity grid so that electricity generation can resume rapidly once the grid failure is rectified. Excess working fluid displaced by the hydraulic pump is stored in an accumulator. When the maximum amount has been stored pressurised fluid is discharged through a throttle to avoid damage but maintain pressure within the hydraulic transmission so that electricity generation can resume rapidly if the grid failure is rectified. If the fault persists, the turbine blades are feathered to reduce power input and if the fault persists for a further period of time, the energy extraction device shuts down."
