To avoid this green house gas problem and yet produce liquid fuels, an electro-thermal energy storage system that may be wind-powered is described. It stores the unpredictable, intermittent (e.g., wind) electrical energy over long periods as thermal energy in fossil hydrocarbon deposits.

With the present method, the losses in power generation of the steam turbine, when said turbine is operating in the Primary Frequency Regulation mode, are reduced to a minimum.

2006,"Disclosed is a drive unit for coaxial rotational movement of two halves (1), (2) of a motor vehicle stabilizer provided with a tubular housing consisting of two housing halves (3), (4), inside which a hydraulically displaceable actuating piston (13) is displaceably arranged. Longitudinal displacement by means of an inserted curve gear (17), (19) is transformed into a rotational movement of the housing halves (3), (4) around their common longitudinal axis. The housing halves (3), (4) are fixed to respectively one of the stabilizer halves (1), (2) with one respective free end thereof facing away from each other. According to the invention, hydraulically actuated release pistons (22), (23) are arranged on opposite flat sides of the actuating piston (13) and can be respectively pre-tensed against a spring element (28), (29). The release pistons (22), (23), when in a pre-tensed position, enable the central actuating piston (13) to be displaced and fix the actuating piston (13) in a middle position when they are in a slackened position. In said embodiment, the above-mentioned hydraulic drive unit is provided with a safety device which ensures in a simple, low-cost manner that the stabilizer is placed in a predefined neutral position in the event of failure of the hydraulic system or on-board electric system."
2006,"An integral electronic meter system diagnostics package including a microprocessor, storage memory, pre-select series of system diagnostic tests, and recording any results which exceed predefined programmable thresholds, and display means for displaying error and/or diagnostic messages identifying selected diagnostic data and/or errors discovered in the meter tests during a predefined period.
