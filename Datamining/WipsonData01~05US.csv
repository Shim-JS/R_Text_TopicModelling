2004,"An electric system utilizes dynamic impedance changes in windings of an electric motor to measure/monitor mechanical position. The method employs a bridge amplifier to measure voltage at a center node or windings against a voltage derived from a reference network.

2001,"A school bus safety device provides an engine status line wired to a voltage detection location. The voltage detection location is a point in the electrical system of the school bus which is typically at a high voltage potential when the engine is in operation, and is at the same potential as ground when the engine is turned off. An edge-triggered logic device, such as a flip-flop, receives the engine status line as a clock pulse input. In a typical application, the falling edge of the engine status line causes the output line of the logic device to go high, thereby driving an annunciator, such as a buzzer. Therefore, turning off the engine of the bus causes the buzzer to sound. The driver walks to the rear of the bus and notices if any sleeping children are left on board. A key switch device, located in the back of the bus, is used to send a reset to the logic device, thereby turning off the buzzer. The driver then walks back to the front of the bus, double-checking to see that all children are off the bus."

2001,"A circuit for controlling an electro-explosive device. The circuit includes a heating element, an input circuit and a load control circuit. The load control circuit is responsive to an electrical input provided by the input circuit for energizing the heating element. The heating element selectively causes ignition of the electro-explosive device when its level of energization reaches a firing level. The load control circuit substantially limits current in the heating element when the electrical input is less than a predetermined threshold for maintaining energization of the heating element at a level less than the firing level to prevent the ignition of the electro-explosive device.

This maintains energization of the heating element at a level greater than the firing level to cause the ignition of the electro-explosive device."

2001,"A weather cover for a boat comprises a fabric cover that completely covers the boat while floating in the water. The cover is gathered tight above the waterline. An air-duct fan inside the cover draws in clean dry air from outside through a filtered vent and a connecting flexible air duct. Such fan runs on electricity provided by shore power, the boats electrical system, or solar panels. The exhaust air is directed through another vent through the cover. The intake cover vent is filled with a replaceable filter foam material. In both vents, a louver opening is directed downward to prevent rain or water spray from entering. The fan need only keep the air inside the boat dry over the long term. The fan therefore may run continuously, or as power is available, e.g., during daylight when the sun is shining. In alternative embodiments, the pressurized air from the fan is valved through to inflate internal support chambers that will keep the cover away from the top surfaces of the boat even after the fan has stopped."
